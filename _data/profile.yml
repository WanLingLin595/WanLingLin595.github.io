    Hi, I am currently a doctoral candidate in the <a href="https://ccds.fzu.edu.cn/">College of Computer and Data Science </a> at <a href="https://www.fzu.edu.cn/">Fuzhou University</a>. My research focuses on data center networks, the design and analysis of algorithms, fault-tolerant routing, fault diagnosis, and social networks.  I am passionate about integrating graph theory with real-world applications to solve practical problems. I am always open to collaborative opportunities and welcome discussions with fellow researchers and practitioners.
